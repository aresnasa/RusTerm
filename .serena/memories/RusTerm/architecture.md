# RusTerm — Architecture & Key Decisions

## Crates

- `rusterm-core` — terminal emulator core (parser, renderer, state machine)
- `rusterm-db` — SQLite primary store (OLTP). `Database` wraps `tokio-rusqlite`.
  - `store.rs`: `save_history`, `save_history_batch`, `search_history` (HAVING clause filters failed commands), `mark_command_failed` (durable failure marker), `known_failed_commands`, `delete_history_by_command` (deprecated — use `mark_command_failed`), `delete_history_by_hostname`, `all_history` (NEW — full table scan for analytics mirror).
  - `history.rs`: `HistoryEntry` struct (id, command, session_id, cwd, hostname, exit_code, duration_ms, created_at).
  - 16+ tests in `store.rs` covering HAVING clause behavior, failure markers, reimport scenarios.
- `rusterm-history` — local-only history providers (bash/zsh/fish/atuin).
  - `HistoryMatch` struct: `#[non_exhaustive]` with `command, cwd, hostname, timestamp, score, exit_code` (exit_code added 2026-07-18 for atuin propagation).
  - `HybridHistoryProvider::search()` merges all sources, dedups by command, preserves `exit_code` from atuin.
  - `AtuinDbProvider` reads `exit_code` column from atuin's `history` table (MAX aggregation biases toward "don't suggest").
  - bash/zsh/fish flat files have NO exit code → `None` → filtered by `known_failed_commands` at import time.
- `rusterm-analytics` (NEW 2026-07-18) — DuckDB-backed OLAP layer.
  - `AnalyticsDB` wraps `duckdb::Connection` in `Mutex` (Connection is Send but not Sync).
  - `AnalyticsCommand` struct: command, hostname, exit_code, created_at (subset of HistoryEntry).
  - Methods: `open`, `open_in_memory`, `record_command`, `total_commands`, `classify`, `success_rate_by_prefix`, `usage_patterns_by_time_of_day`, `behavior_summary`, `clear`.
  - `mirror::mirror_from_sqlite(&analytics, &sqlite_db)` — bulk copy from SQLite → DuckDB.
  - `classify::classify_command()` — prefix-matching into `CommandCategory` enum (Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Rust, NodeJs, Python, Go, Build, FileOps, TextProcessing, Networking, Process, Editor, Navigation, Other). Strips `sudo`/`time`/`nohup` and path prefixes.
  - 14 tests, all passing.
  - **DuckDB gotcha**: `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIMESTAMPTZ)` returns LOCAL hour, not UTC. Use `strftime(ts, '%H')` on a `TIMESTAMPTZ` to get UTC hour.
- `rusterm-ui` — Dioxus desktop UI.
  - `AppState` (Serialize/Deserialize) in `state.rs`: sessions, active_session, sidebar_open, connections, theme, close_senders, resize_senders, config_manager, terminals, session_logs, unlock_state, master_password_error, suggestion_epoch, pending_exit_check, recent_failed_commands (NEW), onekeys, onekey_popups, session_configs, disconnected_sessions, analytics (NEW — `AnalyticsHandle`).
  - `SessionTab`: id, name, kind, render_output, version, suggestion, suggestions, suggestion_selected, suggestion_visible, command_history, hostname.
  - `app.rs` (~2900 lines): `App()` function, `start_ssh_connection`, `start_shell_connection`, `open_local_terminal`, `reconnect_session`.
  - `analytics.rs` (NEW): `AnalyticsHandle` with feature-gated real/stub impls.
  - `components/suggestion_popup.rs`: `SuggestionPopup` component (props: suggestions, selected_index, on_select, on_dismiss, on_delete [NEW]).
  - `components/terminal_view.rs`: `TerminalView` component. Suggestion keyboard handler handles ArrowUp/Down/Tab/Escape/Shift+Delete [NEW]/Enter.
- `rusterm-app` — binary crate.
- `rusterm-ssh`, `rusterm-crypto`, `rusterm-ai`, `rusterm-plugins`, `rusterm-proto` — supporting.

## Feature Flags

- `rusterm-ui/analytics` (NEW) — enables DuckDB analytics. Default OFF. Adds ~50MB to binary (bundled libduckdb C++). When off, `AnalyticsHandle` is a no-op stub.

## Critical Patterns

- **Borrow checker in `app.rs`**: `let mut s = state.write();` then `state.clone()` fails (E0502). MUST `drop(s);` before `state.clone()`. `state_for_mark` must be `let mut` (Dioxus `Signal::write` takes `&mut self`).
- **Failed-command filter**: three layers:
  1. `recent_failed_commands: HashSet<String>` in AppState — immediate UI guard during async DB write
  2. `mark_command_failed(&cmd, rc)` in DB — durable failure marker (DELETEs prior rows, inserts single row with non-zero exit_code)
  3. `HAVING` clause in `search_history` — `SUM(exit_code = 0) > 0 OR SUM(exit_code IS NOT NULL) = 0` keeps commands with at least one success OR all-NULL (unknown)
- **Atuin exit_code propagation**: `AtuinDbProvider::search` reads `MAX(exit_code)` so any failed execution marks the command as failed. `HistoryMatch.exit_code` flows through `hybrid.rs` merge → DB import → `HAVING` filter.
- **Startup import filter**: `_history_import` use_future in `app.rs` fetches `known_failed_commands()` BEFORE building entries and filters them out, preventing re-introduction of typos as NULL-exit-code rows on every launch.
- **Shell integration (OSC 133;D)**: injected inline for zsh (`precmd_functions`) and bash (`PROMPT_COMMAND`) at L1125/L1700. Fish/nu/pwsh NOT supported — failed commands in those shells won't be detected at runtime.
- **User delete feature (Shift+Delete)**: handler in `app.rs` `on_suggestion_delete` removes from `command_history`, `suggestions`, inserts into `recent_failed_commands`, spawns `mark_command_failed(&cmd, 1)`, refreshes inline ghost text, increments `suggestion_epoch`. Uses `mark_command_failed` (NOT `delete_history_by_command`) — deletion would let next import re-introduce as NULL.

## Tests

- 325 tests pass (workspace, no features) as of 2026-07-19.
- Breakdown: 142 in rusterm-ui (was 136 — added 6 tests for Task 19 drag-tab-to-split feature in state.rs), 53 layout tests, 95 in rusterm-core, 25 in rusterm-db, 19 in rusterm-ai, 16 in rusterm-crypto, 14 in rusterm-analytics, rest in other crates.
- Total workspace test count is now 384 (was 383 after the state-level Task 19 fix; +1 for `drop_background_tab_creates_multi_pane_layout_from_single` which pins the render-path switch contract).
- 2 tests intentionally ignored in rusterm-ssh (live SSH tests, gated by `RUSTERM_LIVE_SSH_TEST=1`).
- 325 tests also pass with `--features rusterm-ui/analytics`.
- Note: the uncommitted `scan_cwd`/`session_state`/`command_safety` work in rusterm-core added ~56 tests and a `cwd: Option<PathBuf>` field to `Terminal` (mirrored as `cwd: Option<String>` on `SessionTab`). All `SessionTab` initializers in test helpers include `cwd: None`. The production `SessionTab` initializers in `app.rs` (lines ~2860, ~2920, ~2957, ~2984, ~3785) also include `cwd: None`.

## Drag-and-drop pane rearrangement (Task 16, completed 2026-07-18; performance optimization 2026-07-19)

- **Goal**: let users drag sessions between panes and drag sidebar connections onto panes to open them in specific panes (rather than always as a new active tab).
- **Design decision (grid-only)**: chose to keep the existing uniform row-major grid (every row has the same number of columns) rather than refactoring `PaneLayout` to a tmux-style binary tree. Arbitrary tree-style splits would break the `rows * cols == panes.len()` invariant that `pane_rect` and `visible_panes` rely on, and would invalidate the 41 existing layout tests. The user can still drag sessions between existing panes and drag sidebar connections onto existing panes; splitting panes is left to the existing `cycle_layout_preset` / `apply_layout_preset` path. A future task can introduce tree-based splits if needed.

### Performance optimization (2026-07-19)
- **drag_over_pane signal**: added `drag_over_pane: Signal<Option<usize>>` in `App()` (near other `use_signal` calls) and passed to `multi_pane_container`. Each pane reads `drag_over_pane()` once during `pane_items` Vec construction to compute `border_style` (highlight when `Some(idx)`). This subscribes `App` to the signal — any change triggers ONE re-render of `App` (which rebuilds `pane_items` with the new values). The Signal equality check prevents re-renders for no-op `set(Some(idx))` calls in the high-frequency `ondragover` (~60Hz) handler. The highlight changes only on `ondragenter` (when the dragged pane actually changes), not per dragover-tick. This aligns with the user's "取舍分频性能" preference: fewer re-renders over per-tick feedback.
- **Visual feedback**: panes now show a 2px solid `#7aa2f7` border when dragged-over, 2px transparent border otherwise. `box-sizing: border-box` ensures the border doesn't shift the pane's content. `ondragenter` and `ondragover` set `drag_over_pane.set(Some(idx))`; `ondrop` sets `drag_over_pane.set(None)`. Do NOT use `ondragleave` — it fires when moving between child elements (bubbling), causing flicker.
- **pane_items simplification**: reduced from 5-tuple `(idx, session_id, rect, drop_session_id, drop_pane_idx)` to 5-tuple `(idx, session_id, rect, drop_session_id, border_style)`. Replaced redundant `drop_pane_idx` (a copy of `idx`) with `idx` directly (since `usize` is `Copy`, the ondrop closure captures it without an extra clone). Added `border_style: &'static str` (Copy) pre-computed from `drag_over_pane()` during Vec construction — avoids reading the Signal inside the rsx! `for` body (which is forbidden — `let` statements aren't allowed in the for body).
- **Key stability decision (CRITICAL)**: KEPT the pane key as `pane-{idx}-{session_id}` (did NOT change to `pane-{idx}`). `TerminalView` uses `use_effect` (terminal_view.rs L777-796) and `use_future` (L825-829) that capture `session_id` by clone — these run only on mount. If `session_id` prop changed without remount, the focus/resize scripts would reference stale DOM element IDs (`terminal-input-{old_session}` vs the rendered `terminal-input-{new_session}`). So when a session swaps panes, the TerminalView MUST be remounted (which the `{session_id}` in the key ensures). This is correct behavior, not a perf bug.
- **Performance contract tests** (6 new tests, all passing):
  - `layout.rs`: `swap_panes_preserves_pane_count` (grid invariant preserved through swaps), `set_pane_session_out_of_range_returns_false_without_panicking` (O(1) bounds check), `visible_panes_yields_exactly_panes_len_when_not_zoomed` (no over/under-allocation).
  - `state.rs`: `swap_pane_sessions_only_touches_two_panes` (only 2 panes differ after swap), `set_pane_session_for_active_out_of_range_is_o1_no_panic` (O(1) failure path), `pane_index_for_active_session_returns_none_without_layout_o1` (early-return when no layout).
  - The `drag_over_pane` signal itself lives in the Dioxus runtime (not on `AppState`), so it can't be unit-tested without spinning up a Dioxus runtime. Its behavior is pinned by the call-site comments in `multi_pane_container` instead.
- **Performance characteristics**:
  - **During drag**: `ondragover` fires ~60/sec, each call is O(1) (prevent_default + set_drop_effect + Signal equality check). No re-render per dragover-tick.
  - **On pane-enter**: `drag_over_pane` value changes → ONE re-render of `App()`. Re-render is O(panes) for layout + O(terminal_size) per pane for TerminalView HTML generation. Cheap because terminal output is unchanged (prop comparison short-circuits).
  - **On drop**: 1-2 state writes (set_pane_session_for_active or swap_pane_sessions), triggers ONE re-render. Layout computation is O(panes) = O(16) max.
  - **Allocation**: one `String` clone per pane per render (for `drop_session_id`). Trivial.
- **Data layer** (`crates/rusterm-ui/src/layout.rs`):
  - `PaneLayout::set_pane_session(idx, session_id)` — already existed (line ~329); replaces the session at a pane index. Now also clears a pane when `session_id` is empty.
  - `PaneLayout::swap_panes(a, b)` — NEW. Swaps the `session_id` of two panes; re-anchors `row`/`col` to the pane INDEX (not the session), so `pane_rect` still draws each pane at its grid position. Self-swap is a no-op; out-of-range returns false.
  - `PaneLayout::swap_panes_by_session(from, to)` — NEW. Convenience wrapper that looks up pane indices by session_id.
- **State wrappers** (`crates/rusterm-ui/src/state.rs`):
  - `set_pane_session_for_active(state, pane_idx, session_id) -> bool` — replaces the session at a pane in the active tab's layout.
  - `swap_pane_sessions(state, from_session, to_session) -> bool` — swaps two panes by session id.
  - `pane_index_for_active_session(state, session_id) -> Option<usize>` — looks up the pane index displaying a session.
  - `session_at_pane(state, pane_idx) -> Option<String>` — looks up the session at a pane index.
  - All four return false/None gracefully when there's no active session, no layout, or out-of-range indices. This is what the drop handler uses to fall back to the legacy "open new tab" path.
- **UI wiring** (`crates/rusterm-ui/src/app.rs`, `components/sidebar.rs`, `components/tab_bar.rs`):
  - **Sidebar `ConnItem`**: added `draggable: true` + `ondragstart` handler that sets `application/x-rusterm-connection-id` MIME on the DragEvent's DataTransfer. Sets `drop_effect="copy"` and `effect_allowed="copy"` (semantic: dragging a sidebar connection creates a new session).
  - **TabBar tabs**: added `draggable: true` + `ondragstart` handler that sets `application/x-rusterm-session-id` MIME. Sets `drop_effect="move"` and `effect_allowed="move"` (semantic: dragging an open session moves it).
  - **`multi_pane_container` panes**: each pane `<div>` now has `ondragover` (prevent_default to allow drop) + `ondragenter` (prevent_default for cross-browser compat) + `ondrop` handler. The drop handler reads the MIME type to dispatch:
    - `application/x-rusterm-session-id` present → drag from tab bar. If target pane is empty, move the session there (and clear the source pane via `set_pane_session_for_active`). If target pane has a session, swap via `swap_pane_sessions`. If the dragged session equals the target pane's session, no-op.
    - `application/x-rusterm-connection-id` present → drag from sidebar. Looks up the `ConnectionConfig`, calls `open_connection(state, input_senders, conn, Some(pane_idx))`.
  - **`open_connection` helper** (NEW, `app.rs` ~line 2820): factors out the connection-opening logic from the sidebar's `on_connect` handler. Takes an optional `target_pane_idx: Option<usize>` parameter:
    - `None` → open as a new active tab (legacy "click to connect" flow).
    - `Some(idx)` → open AND assign the new session to pane `idx` via `set_pane_session_for_active`. If there's no layout (active tab is Single preset), falls back to making the new session active. The new session's tab is still pushed to `state.sessions` (so it appears in the tab bar), but `active_session` is NOT changed (the user's active tab stays as whatever they were looking at when they dragged).
  - The existing `on_connect` handler now just calls `open_connection(state, input_senders, conn, None)`.
- **MIME types** (custom, distinguish drag sources):
  - `application/x-rusterm-session-id` — drag from tab bar (move existing session).
  - `application/x-rusterm-connection-id` — drag from sidebar (open new connection).
- **rsx! `for` body constraint**: the dioxus 0.7 rsx! macro does NOT allow `let` statements inside a `for` loop body (the body must be a single rsx element). Workaround: pre-compute owned clones into a Vec before the `rsx!` block, then iterate over the Vec by value in the `for` loop. The `multi_pane_container` now builds a `Vec<(idx, session_id, rect, drop_session_id, drop_pane_idx)>` (5-tuple with redundant clones) before the rsx, and the for pattern destructures all 5 fields.
- **Dioxus 0.7 drag API**: `DragEvent` is in `dioxus::prelude::*` (re-exported via `dioxus_html::events::*`). `e.data_transfer()` returns a `DataTransfer` with `set_data(format, data)`, `get_data(format)`, `set_drop_effect(effect)`, `set_effect_allowed(effect)`. Available events: `ondragstart`, `ondrag`, `ondragend`, `ondragenter`, `ondragover`, `ondragleave`, `ondrop`. Both `ondragover` AND `ondragenter` must call `e.prevent_default()` for the drop to work cross-browser.
- **Borrow checker note**: the drop handler's move closures capture `state: Signal<AppState>` by copy (Signal is Copy). Calling `state.write()` inside a closure requires `state` to be declared `mut` in the enclosing function (`multi_pane_container`'s signature was updated to `mut state: Signal<AppState>`). Multiple sequential `state.write()` calls in the same closure are fine as long as each `let mut s = state.write();` is in its own scope.

## Multi-pane layout (Tasks 14 & 15, completed 2026-07-18)

- `crates/rusterm-ui/src/layout.rs` — `PaneLayout` engine: panes stored row-major with `col_fracs`/`row_fracs` (normalized to sum=1.0). `LayoutPreset` enum: `Single`, `Split2H` (1×2), `Split2V` (2×1), `Grid4` (2×2), `Grid8` (2×4). `MAX_PANES = 16`, `MIN_PANE_FRAC = 0.1`.
- State-level helpers in `state.rs`: `apply_layout_preset`, `cycle_layout_preset`, `toggle_pane_zoom` (全屏), `toggle_comparison_mode` (跨终端比对), `resize_layout_col`/`resize_layout_row`, `broadcast_targets`, `scroll_sync_targets`.
- Layouts are **per-tab** (keyed by active session id in `state.layouts: HashMap<String, PaneLayout>`). Switching tabs preserves each tab's layout.
- `apply_layout_preset` anchors the active session at pane 0 and fills remaining panes with other open sessions in tab order (deduped).
- Render path: `(Some(active), is_multi_pane)` → `multi_pane_container` renders each visible pane via `render_terminal_pane` with absolute positioning; `(Some(active), false)` → legacy single-pane path (also taken when zoomed — the zoomed pane fills the container).
- Splitter bars: click to grow left/top by 5%, right-click to shrink. `resize_col`/`resize_row` reject deltas that would push a pane below `MIN_PANE_FRAC`.
- Comparison mode (`comparison: bool` on PaneLayout): when ON, `broadcast_targets` returns all non-empty pane session_ids (deduped); when OFF, only the active session. Used by `on_input` handler in `render_terminal_pane` to broadcast keystrokes to every pane's PTY (tmux synchronize-panes style).
- Zoom (`zoomed: Option<usize>`): a zoomed pane's `pane_rect` returns the full container; other panes return `None` (hidden but preserved). Unzooming restores prior fracs exactly.
- Toolbar (status bar): `Layout: <preset>` (cycle on click), `Compare` (toggle, highlighted when on), `⤢` (zoom toggle).
- Hotkeys: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+L cycle layout, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+C toggle comparison, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F toggle zoom.
- `layout_entry_is_safe_to_remove_when_session_closes` test pins the cleanup contract: closing a session removes its entry from `layouts`.

## Suggestion-query tracing (added 2026-07-18)

- `[SUGGESTION-QUERY] STALE — spawn epoch=N but current=M (skipped)` — logged in the `on_input` spawn when the epoch check fails (a newer keystroke or the delete handler bumped the epoch).
- `[SUGGESTION-QUERY] session=… line empty — hiding popup` / `cmd_part empty (line=…) — hiding popup` — early-return paths.
- `[SUGGESTION-QUERY] session=… cmd_part=… epoch=… current_epoch=… results=… recent_failed=…` — the main outcome log, emitted right before the popup is shown/hidden. Use this to diagnose "popup doesn't appear after delete": if `results=[]`, the history sources legitimately had no match (after filtering); if `results` is non-empty but the popup still doesn't show, there's a render/Signal issue.

## Icon Assets

- `assets/icon.svg` — full-color macOS app-tile (Rust orange gradient + shield + comet cursor `>` + corner rivets)
- `assets/icon-speed-security.svg` (NEW 2026-07-18) — enhanced version with vault shield (filled), brass padlock at base, motion-tail chevron. Combines Rust-speed + local-security motifs more explicitly.
- `assets/icon-template.svg` — pure-black macOS menu-bar template (per Apple HIG). Shield ring + `> _` prompt glyph.
- `assets/icon-template.icns` — 4 sizes (16, 16@2x, 32, 32@2x).
- `assets/icon-dark.svg`, `assets/icon-a.svg`, `assets/icon-b.svg` — older variants.

## Splitter drag-resize fix (2026-07-19, REVISED)

**Bug**: "分屏无法调整" (can't drag splitter bars to resize panes) + "分屏后无法输入" (can't type after splitting).

**Prior failed approaches** (DO NOT REPEAT):
1. ❌ Overlay with `onmousemove`/`onmouseup` — fails because implicit pointer capture routes events to the splitter (mousedown target), not the overlay.
2. ❌ Splitter bar with `onmousemove`/`onmouseup` — fails because dioxus 0.7's desktop webview (WKWebView/webkitgtk/WebView2) does NOT reliably fire element-level mouse events during a button-held drag. Pointer-capture behavior is inconsistent across webviews.
3. ❌ JS `eval` + `spawn`-installed document listeners — claimed broken by "missing `return` prefix" and "race between spawn and first mousemove". The actual root cause was never confirmed.

**Current (working) fix** — document-level capture-phase listeners + polling `use_future`:

The splitter bar carries ONLY `onmousedown`. When pressed:
1. Sets `split_drag = Some(...)` (mounts a visual-only cursor overlay with `pointer-events: none`).
2. Calls `install_split_drag_js_listeners(x, y)` which `eval`s a JS IIFE that:
   - Initializes `window.__rusterm_drag_pos = 'x,y'` and `window.__rusterm_drag_done = false`.
   - Removes any prior listeners (idempotent).
   - Installs `moveHandler` (capture-phase `document.addEventListener('mousemove', ..., true)`) that writes `e.clientX,e.clientY` to `__rusterm_drag_pos` and calls `preventDefault()`.
   - Installs `upHandler` (capture-phase `document.addEventListener('mouseup', ..., true)`) that sets `__rusterm_drag_done = true` and self-removes both listeners.
   - Stores `window._rusterm_split_drag_remove` for `end_split_drag` to call.

A polling `use_future` in `App` (named `_split_drag_poll`) loops forever:
- When `split_drag` is `None`: sleeps 32ms, re-checks.
- When `split_drag` is `Some`: calls `poll_split_drag_state()` (an `async fn` that `eval`s `"return (function() { ... })()"` to read `__rusterm_drag_pos` + `__rusterm_drag_done` as a string `"x,y,done"`).
  - If `done == true`: calls `end_split_drag` (clears `split_drag`, spawns JS cleanup, restores focus). Loops back to idle (does NOT break — `use_future` only runs its closure once, so breaking would prevent subsequent drags).
  - Else: calls `apply_split_drag_step(state, split_drag, pos)` where `pos` is `x` for col drag, `y` for row drag.
- Sleeps 16ms (60Hz) between polls.

**Why this works** (and prior approaches didn't):
- Document-level capture-phase listeners ALWAYS fire, in every webview, regardless of pointer capture. They fire BEFORE element-level handlers, BEFORE pointer capture kicks in, and keep firing even when the cursor moves outside the original target.
- The polling approach avoids needing JS→Rust callbacks (which dioxus 0.7 doesn't support well — `eval` is request/response only).
- 16ms polling is fast enough for smooth dragging (60Hz, indistinguishable from native).
- The `use_future` runs forever (never breaks), so subsequent drags work without re-mounting the component.

**Focus restore after drag** (`end_split_drag` + `restore_focus_to_active_session`):
- The splitter's `onmousedown` `prevent_default` prevents the splitter from receiving focus (correct), but nothing restored focus to the pane that had it before — so keystrokes went nowhere after the drag. Fix: `end_split_drag` calls `restore_focus_to_active_session(state, 20)` which `eval`s `document.getElementById('terminal-input-{sid}')?.focus()` after a 20ms delay (lets the overlay unmount commit).
- Also called after `cycle_layout_preset` (100ms delay) — applying a new preset re-mounts panes, and the auto-focus `use_effect` in each pane's `TerminalView` may race.

**Key helpers** (all in `app.rs`):
- `SplitDragState { is_col, idx, container_extent, last_applied_pos }` — `last_applied_pos` is viewport-relative (matching `e.client_coordinates()` and JS `e.clientX`/`e.clientY`).
- `build_install_split_drag_script(x, y) -> String` — pure function that builds the JS IIFE string (extracted for unit testing).
- `install_split_drag_js_listeners(x, y)` — calls `build_install_split_drag_script` and `spawn`s the `eval`.
- `parse_split_drag_poll_response(s) -> Option<(f64, f64, bool)>` — pure function that parses the `"x,y,done"` response (extracted for unit testing).
- `poll_split_drag_state() -> Option<(f64, f64, bool)>` — async fn that `eval`s the poll script and calls `parse_split_drag_poll_response`.
- `compute_split_drag_delta(&drag, pos) -> Option<f64>` — pure function, returns the fractional delta to apply (or `None` for no-op: duplicate event or zero container extent).
- `apply_split_drag_step(state, split_drag, pos)` — wraps `compute_split_drag_delta` + `resize_layout_col`/`resize_layout_row` + `last_applied_pos` update.
- `end_split_drag(state, split_drag)` — clears `split_drag`, spawns JS listener cleanup, restores focus.
- `restore_focus_to_active_session(state, delay_ms)` — `eval`s the focus script after a delay.

**Overlay** (in `multi_pane_container`):
- VISUAL CURSOR INDICATOR ONLY. Has `pointer-events: none` so it never intercepts events.
- Shows `col-resize`/`row-resize` cursor across the whole viewport during the drag.
- Carries NO event handlers (the document-level JS listeners handle everything).

**Splitter bar** (in `render_col_splitters`/`render_row_splitters`):
- Width increased from 6px to 10px (easier to grab).
- Carries ONLY `onmousedown` (sets `split_drag`, installs JS listeners) + `oncontextmenu` (5% shrink on right-click).
- `onmousedown` calls `e.stop_propagation()` to prevent any parent handler from interfering.

**Tests** (33 new in this revision, 18 JS-bridge-specific):
- `app.rs::split_drag_tests` (8 tests, unchanged from prior revision): delta computation, viewport-coordinate fix, direction reversal, zero-extent guard, row drag, full drag sequence, focus-restore id format.
- `app.rs::split_drag_js_tests` (18 NEW tests): JS install script structure (IIFE, document capture-phase listeners, preventDefault, self-remove on mouseup, remove function stored), poll response parsing (valid/empty/malformed/negative/integer coordinates, done flag format), round-trip format consistency.
- `layout.rs::tests` (7 tests, unchanged): end-to-end mouse-drag simulations.

**Total test count**: 377 (was 373 before this fix).

## Multi-pane input routing fix (2026-07-19, Task 17/19)

**Bug**: "除了第一个分屏外的其他终端会话都无法输入命令" — in multi-pane mode with comparison OFF, only pane 0 accepted commands; panes 1..N's keystrokes were silently routed to pane 0's PTY.

**Root cause**: `render_terminal_pane`'s `on_input` handler (app.rs ~L206) used a buggy broadcast predicate:
```rust
let is_broadcast = broadcast_targets.len() > 1
    || (broadcast_targets.len() == 1 && broadcast_targets[0] != sid_clone);
```
The second clause `(len == 1 && broadcast_targets[0] != sid_clone)` was intended to handle some edge case but actually broke non-comparison multi-pane input. Since `broadcast_targets` returns `[active_session]` when comparison is OFF, pane N (N>0) had `broadcast_targets[0] = active_session != sid_clone (pane_N_session)` → `is_broadcast = true` → keystrokes were sent to `broadcast_targets` (= `[active_session]` = pane 0's PTY) instead of `sid_clone` (pane N's own PTY).

**Fix**: changed the predicate to `is_broadcast = broadcast_targets.len() > 1`. This is true ONLY when comparison is ON with 2+ non-empty pane sessions (the only case where `broadcast_targets` returns >1 entry). In all other cases, each pane sends to its own `sid_clone`.

**Critical design insight**: `active_session` is a **tab pointer**, NOT a **focused-pane pointer**. Layouts are keyed by `active_session` in `state.layouts: HashMap<String, PaneLayout>` (see `App` render path at app.rs ~L4688: `state.read().layouts.get(sid)`). Changing `active_session` on pane click would break the layout lookup (the new `active_session` might not have a layout entry → `is_multi = false` → single-pane fallback). So clicking a pane does NOT update `active_session` — it only updates DOM focus via `onclick_focus` in terminal_view.rs (L1005). This is correct: `active_session` stays as the tab's session, and each pane routes its own input to its own PTY.

**`onclick_focus` in terminal_view.rs (L1005-1016)**: only sets the local `focused` signal + calls `document.getElementById('terminal-input-{cid}')?.focus()`. Does NOT (and must not) update `active_session`. The auto-focus `use_effect` (L794-828) has a `document.activeElement` check to avoid multi-pane mount races — this is correct and should not be removed.

**Tests** (4 new in `state.rs::tests`, all passing):
- `non_comparison_multi_pane_input_routes_to_each_pane_own_session` — Split2H + comparison OFF → predicate false for all panes (the direct regression).
- `after_drag_swap_panes_input_still_routes_to_own_session` — simulates drag-and-drop pane swap via `swap_pane_sessions`, verifies predicate still false after swap (covers the "drag session onto pane → new pane can accept input" flow at the state level).
- `comparison_on_multi_pane_input_broadcasts_to_all_panes` — Grid4 + comparison ON → predicate true (pins that the fix didn't break synchronization).
- `comparison_on_single_non_empty_pane_does_not_broadcast` — Grid4 + comparison ON + only 1 non-empty pane → predicate false (edge case: only one target anyway).

**Why no dioxus-runtime test**: `on_input` is a closure inside `render_terminal_pane` which requires a Dioxus desktop runtime + webview to execute. The routing decision is purely a function of `broadcast_targets` (which IS unit-testable) + the `len > 1` predicate. The tests pin both: the `broadcast_targets` output for each scenario AND the corrected predicate. The actual DOM event flow (click pane → focus → keydown → on_input) is a webview concern that can't be unit-tested.

## Drag tab from top bar to create split pane (Task 19, completed 2026-07-19; UI wiring fix 2026-07-19)

**Goal**: dragging a session tab from the top tab bar onto a pane that already has a session should CREATE a new split pane for the dragged session (not just move/swap into existing panes). Previously, drag-drop only moved/swapped sessions between EXISTING panes — dropping a background tab (a session NOT in any pane) onto a filled pane silently failed because `swap_pane_sessions` looks up the source pane index and returns `false` when the source isn't in any pane.

**Fix (state level)**: new state helper `drop_background_tab_to_create_split(state, dragged_sid, target_pane_idx) -> DropSplitOutcome` in `state.rs`. The drop handler in `app.rs` (`multi_pane_container`'s `ondrop`) now checks `pane_index_for_active_session(state, dragged_sid)` BEFORE attempting a swap:
- If `Some(_)` → pane-to-pane drag → `swap_pane_sessions` (existing behavior).
- If `None` → background-tab drag → `drop_background_tab_to_create_split` (new behavior).

**Fix (UI wiring, 2026-07-19)** — THE KEY FIX that made the feature actually work in the running app:

The state-level fix was correct but the UI drag-drop still didn't create a split. Root cause: the App render path (`app.rs` ~L4798) has TWO branches — `(Some(sid), true) → multi_pane_container` and `(Some(sid), false) → render_terminal_pane`. The drop handlers with `drop_background_tab_to_create_split` live ONLY in `multi_pane_container`. When the user has a single session with NO layout (the most common starting state — Single preset), the App takes the `(Some(sid), false)` branch and renders `render_terminal_pane`, which returns a bare `TerminalView` with NO drop handlers. Drops from the tab bar went nowhere.

Fix: new helper `single_pane_with_drop(state, input_senders, render_sid, drag_over_pane)` in `app.rs` (~L849). Wraps `render_terminal_pane` in a `<div>` with `ondragover`/`ondragenter`/`ondrop` handlers that mirror `multi_pane_container`'s per-pane drop logic:
- `application/x-rusterm-session-id` present → if `dragged_sid == render_sid`, no-op; else if `pane_index_for_active_session(state, dragged_sid).is_some()`, no-op (session is in a hidden pane of a zoomed layout — user should unzoom); else call `drop_background_tab_to_create_split(state, dragged_sid, 0)`.
- `application/x-rusterm-connection-id` present → `open_connection(state, input_senders, conn, Some(0))` (falls back to making the new session active when there's no layout — acceptable).

The `(Some(sid), false) =>` branch now calls `single_pane_with_drop(state, input_senders, render_sid, drag_over_pane)` instead of `render_terminal_pane` directly. After the drop creates a Split2H layout, the next render sees `is_multi = true` and switches to `multi_pane_container`, which has its own per-pane drop handlers for subsequent drags.

The `drag_over_pane` signal is shared between `single_pane_with_drop` and `multi_pane_container` — the single-pane path uses `Some(0)` (the only pane) so the highlight border (`#7aa2f7`) is consistent across single-pane and multi-pane modes.

**`drop_background_tab_to_create_split` strategy** (uniform-grid model, NOT a binary tree):
1. No layout yet (Single preset) → apply `Split2H`, place dragged session in pane 1.
2. Layout has an empty pane slot → fill it via `set_pane_session_for_active` (preset unchanged).
3. No empty slots → cycle to next larger preset (`Single→Split2H`, `Split2H/Split2V→Grid4`, `Grid4→Grid8`). `apply_layout_preset` re-fills ALL panes from `state.sessions` in tab order — the dragged session is usually placed naturally. If not, manually place it in the first empty slot.
4. Already at `Grid8` (max) → return `FallbackSwap` → caller attempts `swap_pane_sessions` (which will also fail silently since the source isn't in a pane, but the contract is documented).

**`DropSplitOutcome` enum** (returned by the helper, lets the caller log/fall back):
- `Created { pane_idx }` — new pane created (preset upgraded) and dragged session placed.
- `FilledExisting { pane_idx }` — existing empty slot filled (preset unchanged).
- `FallbackSwap` — at Grid8 max; caller should attempt swap.
- `Failed` — no active session or unexpected state mutation failure.

**CRITICAL invariants preserved**:
- `active_session` is NOT updated (it's a tab pointer; the layout is keyed by it). Changing it would break the layout lookup.
- `apply_layout_preset` re-fills ALL panes — any manual `set_pane_session_for_active` must come AFTER.
- The multi-pane input routing fix (`is_broadcast = broadcast_targets.len() > 1`) is unaffected — the new pane's session is in `state.sessions` (it was dragged from the tab bar), so it has a PTY sender in `input_senders` already.
- After creating a new pane, `restore_focus_to_active_session(state, 80)` is called to restore focus after the new pane's DOM commits.

**Tests** (7 in `state.rs::tests`, all passing):
- `drop_background_tab_creates_split_when_no_layout` — Single → Split2H, dragged session in pane 1.
- `drop_background_tab_creates_multi_pane_layout_from_single` (NEW 2026-07-19) — pins that after the drop, `layout.is_multi_pane()` is true, which is what triggers the App render-path switch from `single_pane_with_drop` to `multi_pane_container`.
- `drop_background_tab_fills_existing_empty_slot` — Grid4 with 1 empty slot → fills it, preset unchanged.
- `drop_background_tab_cycles_split2h_to_grid4` — Split2H full → Grid4, dragged session placed.
- `drop_background_tab_at_grid8_returns_fallback_swap` — Grid8 full → `FallbackSwap` (no mutation).
- `drop_background_tab_returns_failed_with_no_active_session` — defensive contract.
- `after_drop_background_tab_input_routes_to_each_pane_own_session` — after creating a split, the routing predicate is still false with comparison OFF (regression for the Task 17/19 input bug).

**Why no dioxus-runtime test for `single_pane_with_drop`**: the wrapper is a dioxus `rsx!` function that requires a desktop runtime + webview to execute. Its drop logic mirrors `multi_pane_container`'s per-pane `ondrop` (which also can't be unit-tested for the same reason). The state-level helper IS unit-testable, and the `is_multi_pane()` contract test pins the render-path switch. The actual DOM event flow (drag tab → drop → state update → re-render → multi_pane_container) is a webview concern that can't be unit-tested.

## Manual mouse-based tab drag (Task 22, replaces HTML5 DnD for tabs)

**Why HTML5 DnD was abandoned for tabs**: HTML5 drag-and-drop (`draggable: true`, `ondragstart`, `ondrop`) was UNRELIABLE in dioxus 0.7's desktop webview (WKWebView on macOS, WebView2 on Windows, webkitgtk on Linux). Despite correct state-level logic (`drop_background_tab_to_create_split` — 6 passing tests) and correct UI wiring (`single_pane_with_drop` wrapper, multi-pane `ondrop` handlers), the user reported across tasks 17, 19, and 22 that dragging a tab onto a pane didn't create a split. The splitter drag-resize feature hit the SAME wall and was fixed by switching to document-level capture-phase JS listeners + polling (see the "Splitter drag-resize fix" section). Task 22 reworked tab drags to mirror that PROVEN pattern exactly.

**What was replaced**:
- `tab_bar.rs`: tab div's `draggable: true` + `ondragstart` REMOVED. Replaced with `onmousedown` (primary button only) that calls a new `on_drag_start: EventHandler<(String, String, f64, f64)>` prop (session_id, session_name, x, y). The close button got `onmousedown: stop_propagation` so closing a tab doesn't start a drag.
- `multi_pane_container` pane title bar: `draggable: true` + `ondragstart` REMOVED. Replaced with `onmousedown` (primary button only) that calls `start_tab_drag`. The `multi_pane_container` signature gained a `tab_drag: Signal<Option<TabDragState>>` param.
- `single_pane_with_drop` and `multi_pane_container` `ondrop` session-id branches: refactored to call the new `execute_tab_drop_on_pane` state function (dedup). These branches are now defensive fallbacks — the manual mouse-based system is the primary path. The connection-id branches (sidebar→pane, Task 16) remain HTML5-based and untouched.

**What was added** (mirrors the splitter drag-resize fix structure exactly):
- `TabDragState { session_id, session_name, start_x, start_y, cur_x, cur_y, dragging }` (`#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]`) in `app.rs`.
- `TAB_DRAG_THRESHOLD = 6.0` (CSS px) — minimum cursor displacement for a mousedown to promote to a drag.
- `tab_drag_threshold_exceeded(start_x, start_y, cur_x, cur_y) -> bool` (Euclidean distance > threshold) — pure, tested.
- `build_install_tab_drag_script(x, y) -> String` — pure fn, builds JS IIFE string (unit-tested). Uses SEPARATE global variable names from the splitter (`__rusterm_tab_drag_pos`, `__rusterm_tab_drag_done`, `_rusterm_tab_drag_remove`) so the two systems can't clobber each other. **KEY difference from the splitter's script**: the `upHandler` RECORDS the final mouse position (the splitter's `upHandler` only set the done flag — a tab drop needs the release coordinates for hit-testing). Also captures `#terminal-content`'s `getBoundingClientRect()` at install time into `__rusterm_tab_drag_container_left/top` (the polling loop reads these to convert viewport-relative cursor coords into container-relative coords for hit-testing).
- `parse_tab_drag_poll_response(s) -> Option<(f64, f64, bool, f64, f64)>` — returns `(x, y, done, container_left, container_top)`; format `"x,y,done,left,top"` — pure, tested.
- `poll_tab_drag_state() -> Option<(f64, f64, bool, f64, f64)>` — async fn `eval`s the poll script.
- `install_tab_drag_js_listeners(x, y)` — `spawn`s the `eval`.
- `start_tab_drag(tab_drag, session_id, session_name, x, y)` — sets signal (`dragging: false`) + installs JS listeners.
- `hit_test_pane_at(cursor_x, cursor_y, container_left, container_top, container_w, container_h, layout: &PaneLayout) -> Option<(usize, String)>` — pure, tested. Iterates `layout.visible_panes(w, h)` (container-relative px rects); returns first pane containing the cursor. Caller handles single-pane path separately (cursor in container rect → `Some((0, render_sid))`).
- `finish_tab_drag(state, tab_drag, drag_over_pane, container_size, final_x, final_y, container_left, container_top)` (annotated `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]`) — does final hit-test, calls `execute_tab_drop_on_pane`, logs outcome, calls `restore_focus_to_active_session(state, 80)` on `SplitCreated`/`SplitFilledExisting`, clears `tab_drag` + `drag_over_pane`, spawns JS cleanup, restores focus (20ms delay).
- `_tab_drag_poll` `use_future` in `App` (mirrors `_split_drag_poll`): loops forever; idle 32ms sleep when `tab_drag` None; polls 16ms when Some. On each poll: updates `tab_drag`'s `cur_x`/`cur_y`; if `!dragging && threshold_exceeded` → `dragging = true`; if `done` → `finish_tab_drag` (only if `dragging` was true; else click cleanup); else if `dragging` → live hit-test → `drag_over_pane.set(target_idx)`. **NEVER breaks**.
- Ghost element in `App` (after the `match` block, before `AiPanel`): when `tab_drag().dragging == true`, renders `div { position: fixed; left: {cur_x+12}px; top: {cur_y+14}px; pointer-events: none; z-index: 9999; background: #24283b; border: 1px solid #7aa2f7; padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 4px; font-size: 12px; color: #c0caf5; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.4); } "{session_name}" }`.

**Click vs drag**: `onmousedown` sets `tab_drag` with `dragging: false`. The poll loop watches the cursor; once it moves more than `TAB_DRAG_THRESHOLD` (6px) from the start, `dragging` becomes `true`. The drop is ONLY executed on `mouseup` if `dragging == true`. This preserves plain click-to-select: a mousedown with no significant mousemove is a click — the poll cleans up the signal and the tab's `onclick` fires normally. (The close button's `onmousedown: stop_propagation` ensures closing a tab doesn't start a drag.)

**Single source of truth for drop dispatch**: `execute_tab_drop_on_pane(state, dragged_sid, target_pane_idx, target_pane_session) -> TabDropOutcome` in `state.rs`. Called by BOTH the manual mouse-based `finish_tab_drag` AND the (now-residual) HTML5 `ondrop` handlers in `single_pane_with_drop` / `multi_pane_container`. This deduplication keeps the dispatch logic in one unit-testable place — the UI layers just hand off `(dragged_sid, target_pane_idx, target_pane_session)`. Logic: (1) self-drop → `NoOpSelfDrop`; (2) target empty → move (clear source if any) / assign; (3) target non-empty + src in pane → swap; (3b) target non-empty + src NOT in pane → `drop_background_tab_to_create_split` (background tab → create split).

**`TabDropOutcome` enum** (returned by `execute_tab_drop_on_pane`): `NoOpSelfDrop`, `MovedToEmptyPane { cleared_source_pane: Option<usize> }`, `AssignedToEmptyPane`, `Swapped`, `SwapFailed`, `SplitCreated { pane_idx }`, `SplitFilledExisting { pane_idx }`, `SplitFallbackSwapFailed`, `SplitFailed`.

**Tests** (38 new total):
- `state.rs::tests::execute_tab_drop_*` (7 new): self-drop no-op, pane-to-pane swap, background→create split, pane-to-empty move, background→empty assign, background→cycles preset, background→Grid8 fallback swap fails.
- `app.rs::tab_drag_tests` (31 new): `tab_drag_threshold_exceeded` (4 — below/above/Euclidean/constant), `build_install_tab_drag_script` (8 — initializes pos, clears done, IIFE, capture-phase, stores remove fn, upHandler records position, captures container offset, removes prior listeners, separate globals from splitter), `parse_tab_drag_poll_response` (8 — valid in-progress/done, empty, too few/many fields, non-numeric, negative, integer, zero offset), `hit_test_pane_at` (8 — single pane, outside container left/above, Split2H left/right/boundary, Grid4 top-right/bottom-left, container right edge exclusive).

**Total test count**: 422 (was 384 before Task 22). Clippy warnings: 62 (was 63 — actually reduced by 1 from dedup).

**HTML5 DnD REMAINS for**: sidebar→pane connection drags (Task 16, untouched). The `application/x-rusterm-connection-id` MIME type and the `ondrop` connection-id branches in `single_pane_with_drop` / `multi_pane_container` are unchanged.

**Critical invariants preserved**:
- `active_session` is NOT updated on drop (it's a tab pointer; layouts are keyed by it).
- `apply_layout_preset` re-fills ALL panes — manual `set_pane_session_for_active` must come AFTER (only relevant inside `drop_background_tab_to_create_split`).
- The multi-pane input routing fix (`is_broadcast = broadcast_targets.len() > 1`) is unaffected.
- The splitter drag-resize fix is untouched — the tab-drag system mirrors its structure but uses separate JS global names.
- `_tab_drag_poll` `use_future` NEVER breaks (loops forever; idle 32ms sleep).
- `upHandler` records final mouse position (unlike the splitter's `upHandler` — a tab drop needs the release coordinates for hit-testing).
- No re-entrant signal writes: `tab_drag.read()` borrow is dropped before `state.write()` in `finish_tab_drag`.
- The poll `use_future` only executes a drop if `dragging == true` (preserves plain click-to-select).

## Task 22 runtime bug: active-tab self-drop silently no-oped (FIXED 2026-07-19)

**Symptom**: user dragged a tab into the terminal area — nothing happened, despite the whole manual mouse-drag chain working (422 tests passing).

**Diagnosis via file logs** (`~/Library/Application Support/rusterm/logs/rusterm.log.*`, JSON lines, target `rusterm_ui::app`): 9 × `[TAB-DRAG] done flag detected ... finishing drag` entries proved mousedown → JS listeners → poll → `finish_tab_drag` all worked at runtime. But ZERO outcome logs (`created split`/`swapped`/`drop failed` are info/warn) followed — every drop fell into a then-debug-level silent branch. 4 release points were dead-center in the terminal area → hit-test must have hit pane 0 → the only possible branch was `NoOpSelfDrop`: **the user drags the ACTIVE tab (the natural gesture), the single-pane hit-test resolves to pane 0 which holds the active session itself → self-drop → silent no-op**.

**Initial fix** (`state.rs::execute_tab_drop_on_pane` case 1): self-drop with NO layout for the active session applied `Split2H` and returned `SplitCreated { pane_idx: 1 }` (pane 0 keeps active session; pane 1 auto-fills next background tab via `apply_layout_preset`'s fill order, or stays empty `""`). Multi-pane self-drop was still `NoOpSelfDrop`.

**Extended fix (2026-07-19, "自由分裂")**: self-drop in a MULTI-PANE layout now also grows the grid to the next larger preset (Split2H/Split2V → Grid4, Grid4 → Grid8), PRESERVING the existing pane arrangement (unlike `apply_layout_preset`, which re-fills all panes in tab order and would blow away manual rearrangements). Implementation: seed `PaneLayout::from_preset(next, &ids)` with the current panes' session ids in order (from_preset pads new slots with `""`), copy `comparison` flag, then auto-fill the new empty slots with background tabs not already placed (in tab order). Repeated drags thus freely create more sub-panes: 1→2→4→8. At Grid8 (8 panes) the self-drop is `NoOpSelfDrop` (max). `pane_idx` returned is the index of the first newly-created slot (for logging/focus). Layout preset inferred from pane count (NOT global `state.layout_preset` — layouts are per-tab). Existing test `execute_tab_drop_self_drop_is_noop` replaced with `execute_tab_drop_self_drop_multi_pane_grows_grid` (asserts growth + preservation). Added `execute_tab_drop_self_drop_growth_fills_new_slots_with_background_tabs` and `execute_tab_drop_repeated_self_drops_grow_until_grid8_then_noop`.

**Empty-pane placeholder**: empty-session panes (drop-zones) now render a VISIBLE dashed-border placeholder ("拖拽标签页或侧栏连接到此处") instead of nothing. Title bar shows "空白窗格". Empty panes' title bar `onmousedown` won't start a tab drag (guard `!drag_sid.is_empty()`).

**Log level change**: `finish_tab_drag`'s two silent branches (`self-drop no-op`, `release outside any pane`) upgraded from `tracing::debug!` to `tracing::info!` so future runtime diagnosis works at the default filter.

**Tests**: workspace total = 427 (was 424). +1 net for the self-drop growth tests (replaced 1, added 3) and +1 for `tab_drag_install_script_suppresses_text_selection_and_restores_it`.

## Drag-time text selection fix (2026-07-19)

**Symptom**: "拖拽时文本被错误选中" — during a tab drag, page text (terminal content + tab labels) got blue-highlighted. moveHandler's `e.preventDefault()` is insufficient in WebKit because selection started on the mousedown (before moveHandler runs).

**Fix (3 layers)**:
1. **Static CSS** `user-select: none; -webkit-user-select: none;` on tab divs (tab_bar.rs) and pane title bars (multi_pane_container).
2. **`e.prevent_default()` on tab/pane-title `onmousedown`** (primary button only) — blocks the native text-selection drag at the source. Safe for `onclick` (click still fires after a prevented mousedown per the HTML spec; splitter already uses this pattern).
3. **JS-side body-level suppression** in `build_install_tab_drag_script`: on install set `document.body.style.webkitUserSelect = 'none'` (+ `userSelect`) and `window.getSelection().removeAllRanges()`; restore (`= ''`) and clear selection in the `_rusterm_tab_drag_remove` function AND in both Rust-side cleanup evals (finish_tab_drag's end-cleanup + _tab_drag_poll's click-cleanup). Defensive: redundant restores are idempotent.

**Tests**: +1 `tab_drag_install_script_suppresses_text_selection_and_restores_it` (asserts both `webkitUserSelect = 'none'` set on install and `= ''` restored in remove fn).

## Container-size measurement fix (2026-07-19, "窗口无法被填满")

**Symptom**: panes didn't fill the window — both panes ended ~100-250px above the window bottom, full-width blank strip below. `container_size` was `None` → fallback `(1200, 800)` → panes sized 800 tall in a ~1060 tall container → bottom gap.

**Root cause**: the ResizeObserver install ran ONCE at startup in `_container_measure` `use_future`, BEFORE `#terminal-content` existed (unlock screen / no session). The `if (!el || el._rusterm_ro) return;` guard silently bailed → observer never installed → `_rusterm_container_resize_pending` never set → poll returned `''` forever → `container_size` stuck at `None`.

**Fix**: moved observer install INTO the per-tick poll script. Each 100ms tick: get `#terminal-content`; if missing return `''`; if no `_rusterm_ro` yet, install ResizeObserver + force `_rusterm_container_resize_pending = true` for an immediate measure; then if the flag is set, clear it and return `getBoundingClientRect` dimensions. The `el._rusterm_ro` guard still prevents re-install on the SAME element instance; a remounted element (fresh DOM instance, no `_rusterm_ro`) gets a fresh observer + forced measure. 100ms tick rate keeps the retry cheap.

## Diagnosis tips (macOS)**:
- Logs go to daily-rotating JSON files under `~/Library/Application Support/rusterm/logs/` (`rusterm-core::logging::init_logging`); default `EnvFilter` directive `rusterm=info` — launch with `RUST_LOG=rusterm_ui=debug` to see debug lines.
- Browser MCP can't attach to WKWebView; CGEvent mouse simulation needs Accessibility trust (`AXIsProcessTrusted()` was false for the agent terminal) — file-log forensics is the practical runtime-diagnosis channel.

## Known Issues / Future Work

- DuckDB `bundled` build is slow (~2min cold). Consider pre-built libduckdb for CI.
- `AnalyticsHandle` in AppState is cloned by `Arc<Mutex<...>>` but the runtime path re-opens DuckDB on each successful command (not using the shared handle) — a future optimization should pass the handle clone into the spawn.
- No UI panel yet for analytics — the API is ready (`classify`, `success_rate_by_prefix`, `usage_patterns_by_time_of_day`, `behavior_summary`).
- Shell integration not loaded for fish/nu/pwsh — failed commands in those shells won't be filtered at runtime.
- `block v0.1.6` future-incompat warning — pre-existing, external dependency, not our code.
